# Predicting Music Popularity
This is the code of my final year project for my disseration. I am trying to add inline comments along the way for ease of understanding. This is what each file is for: 
* 3yp-code-test - Just a place to test code snippets, not really relevant
* 3yp-data-plots - A place to make plots purely on the data
* 3yp-get-data - A script to get the data from the spotify api - you input a playlist and it gets all the features for the songs in that playlist in a csv
* 3yp-main - Contains the main machine learning bits, using some classifiers on the data to compare their performance
* 3yp-main-new - Updated names of data columns and added a column so this treats the new data and it is a bit more concise - will soon replace 3yp-main
* data_400_entries -  A data sample with 400 entries
* data_600_entries - A data sample with 600 entries

To use the code that relies on the Spotify API you will need to use your own credentials. Other than that if you have all the dependencies in the imports it should work for you as well.
